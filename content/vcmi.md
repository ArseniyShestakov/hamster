I'm currently working on [VCMI](https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi) engine. It's work in progress open source implementation of Heroes of Might and Magic 3 from 1999. This is one of favorite games of my childhood and I decide to work on it since I was always liked open source projects such as [OpenMW](https://openmw.org/) and [OpenTTD](https://www.openttd.org/).

Over years I worked on almost all parts of the engine and learned a lot of things about cross platform development, bug testing, continuous integration, packaging and shipping builds for multiple operation systems. I also maintain project infrastructure and helping to keep some presence in social networks so more people know about the project once it's fully playable.

Experience of working in team of people who love what they doing is priceless. I'm really thankful for everyone who participated the project with me, gave feedback on my code or just criticized it. Thanks everyone!
