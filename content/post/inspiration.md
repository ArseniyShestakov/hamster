Last post I've posted here more than two years ago. Yesterday I decided to update blog to use newer version of theme, hugo and switch to use Github Actions for deployment. Hopefully now I'll actually start using it as I feel it could be a great tool to improve my own productivity.

# Inspiration

I've been working toward sharing more information publicly for a while now starting with my Twitter account, but now I have big goal of trying to do it consistently to report my progress toward being financially independent and building my own business.

From time to time I find these people, interviews, podcasts or courses that give me this eureka moments. Last month I've been listening to multiple podcasts and this time inspiration came from outside: during reading and listening to [Naval Ravikant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Ravikant). If you don't know about him make sure to check out his interviews and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/naval).

It wasn't some eye opening experience or secret knoledge, but it was sufficient motivation for me to publicly commit to share more information about my learning and side project development.

I had my own private diary that I share with no one. While even I almost never ever read it existence of said diary help me to stick to my goals. Hopefully sharing information about what I learning or working on will boost my productivity even more than that.
