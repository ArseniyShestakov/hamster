My name is Arseniy and I am software engineer.

I started my path as freelance web developer, but over years I managed to try a bit of everything. I don't have deep specialization in any specific area, but I know how to get project from idea to launch and further marketing and development. If you want to learn about my coding life please check "[Not a CV]({{< ref "not-a-cv.md" >}} "Not a CV")" or "[Projects]({{< ref "/categories/projects" >}})" pages.

However my interests are not limited to computers. I love to travel, swim in the sea, meet new people and learn new things. Books and games are my passions, but I also enjoy podcasts, educational YouTube channels and other sorts of entertainment. I lived in 3 different countries, made many friends across the globe and always try to meet more people.

# Gaming

While I enjoy all kind of music, books and TV shows main hobby of my life is PC gaming. Started playing on PC since 1996 and I still huge fan of classical games of many genres from Black Isle, BioWare, Bullfrog, NWC, etc. Some of my favorite games are Fallout 1 / 2, Heroes of Might and Magic 2 / 3, Jagged Alliance 2, Populous, Dungeon Keeper, Age of Empires, Seven Kingdoms, Total Annihilation and there are many more.

I enjoy modern games starting from everything Obsidian Entertainment produced or the Witcher series. While I was never big fan of MMO or FPS games I still spent many months in PlanetSide 2 and it's another game that will always hold special place in my heart.

Back in 2013-2015 I actively participated development of game called Planetary Annihilation providing testing and technical support as volunteer. It's was enjoyable experience so I decide that I want to become game developer myself and then...

# Open source

By that time I was using Linux for almost decade and even today I use a lot of open source software not only on Linux, but macOS and Windows. While wanting to make games I never tried to make it my full time job since it's not the easiest industry to work in.

Linux gaming wasn't so alive as it's now so I wanted to support it. I decide to learn something new and contribute to open source. After looking around I found amazing project called [VCMI]({{< ref "vcmi.md" >}} "VCMI") that reimplements my favorite childhood game Heroes of Might and Magic 3. So I joined in and hopefully managed to improve this project a bit over years.

# Gamedev

In the middle of 2020 I've been heavily into Java development and very busy, but good friend of mine shown me PC game their team been developing for a while. I liked it and immediately wanted to help, but in the end I only joined team in the beginning of 2021.

[Dwarven Skykeep](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1076120/Dwarven_Skykeep/) is the first project where I participate not as volunteer or programmer, but as QA since that was area where I can have most impact on a project. I find it very interesting to both test game myself and look how other players learn it.
