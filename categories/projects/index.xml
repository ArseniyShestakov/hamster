It&amp;rsquo;s work in progress open source implementation of Heroes of Might and Magic 3 from 1999. This is one of favorite games of my childhood and I decide to work on it since I was always liked open source projects such as OpenMW and OpenTTD.
Over years I worked on almost all parts of the engine and learned a lot of things about cross platform development, bug testing, continuous integration, packaging and shipping builds for multiple operation systems.</description></item></channel></rss>
