Yesterday I decided to update blog to use newer version of theme, hugo and switch to use Github Actions for deployment. Hopefully now I&amp;rsquo;ll actually start using it as I feel it could be a great tool to improve my own productivity.
Inspiration I&amp;rsquo;ve been working toward sharing more information publicly for a while now starting with my Twitter account, but now I have big goal of trying to do it consistently to report my progress toward being financially independent and building my own business.</description></item><item><title>Experimental static website</title><link>https://arseniyshestakov.com/2015/12/23/experimental-static-website/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://arseniyshestakov.com/2015/12/23/experimental-static-website/</guid><description>This is my first attempt to create personal website using Hugo.
I&amp;rsquo;m used wordpress for almost ten years and made many projects with it, but for personal website that will be rarely updated it&amp;rsquo;s feels like overkill and ability to host it on GitHub Pages is nice advantage too.</description></item></channel></rss>
