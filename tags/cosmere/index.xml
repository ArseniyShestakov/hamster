Additionally I wanted to explore modern fantasy as It&amp;rsquo;s was favorite genre of my childhood while I only barely touched it since.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyhow I end up listening books almost non-stop especially for the last year and half. Thanks to friends who provided me with recommendations today my reading list is more varied, but I managed to finish plenty of fantasy series. I was never particularly skilled at reviewing specific books and listening with extremely fast pace doesn&amp;rsquo;t help with it either, but I feel it&amp;rsquo;s time to draw some conclusions. &lt;strong>Since it&amp;rsquo;s not really reviews I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to only leave few very minor spoilers in this post so everyone can read safely!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
