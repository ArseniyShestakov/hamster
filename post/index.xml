      <title>The Journey of Fantasy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, after only ever touching technical literature for many years, I got back to books since their audio format looked like a right way to improve vocabulary. Additionally I wanted to explore modern fantasy as It&amp;rsquo;s was favorite genre of my childhood while I only barely touched it since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow I end up listening books almost non-stop especially for the last year and half. Thanks to friends who provided me with recommendations today my reading list is more varied, but I managed to finish plenty of fantasy series. I was never particularly skilled at reviewing specific books and listening with extremely fast pace doesn&amp;rsquo;t help with it either, but I feel it&amp;rsquo;s time to draw some conclusions. &lt;strong&gt;Since it&amp;rsquo;s really not really reviews I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to only leave few very minor spoilers in this post so everyone can read safely!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TLDR: If you use FOSS drivers with DRI3 you now can do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use GPU on Linux for any 3D applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pass it into VM and do anything with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once VM is shutdown use GPU on host again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything without reboot and X server restart.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Experimental static website</title>

      <description>This is my first attempt to create personal website using Hugo.
I&amp;rsquo;m used wordpress for almost ten years and made many projects with it, but for personal website that will be rarely updated it&amp;rsquo;s feels like overkill and ability to host it on GitHub Pages is nice advantage too.</description>
