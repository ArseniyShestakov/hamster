You probably wont find this article useful if you are citizen of western country with established career and good track record of work experience. People who choose immigration always have to go through a lot of hoops to find a job and specifically one that offer visa assistance and relocation.</description></item><item><title>Update and Inspiration</title><link>https://arseniyshestakov.com/2021/08/04/update-and-inspiration/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://arseniyshestakov.com/2021/08/04/update-and-inspiration/</guid><description>Last post I&amp;rsquo;ve posted here more than two years ago. Yesterday I decided to update blog to use newer version of theme, hugo and switch to use Github Actions for deployment. Hopefully now I&amp;rsquo;ll actually start using it as I feel it could be a great tool to improve my own productivity.
Inspiration I&amp;rsquo;ve been working toward sharing more information publicly for a while now starting with my Twitter account, but now I have big goal of trying to do it consistently to report my progress toward being financially independent and building my own business.</description></item><item><title>The Journey of Fantasy</title><link>https://arseniyshestakov.com/2018/12/31/the-journey-of-fantasy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://arseniyshestakov.com/2018/12/31/the-journey-of-fantasy/</guid><description>&lt;p>Two years ago, after only ever touching technical literature for many years, I got back to books since their audio format looked like a right way to improve vocabulary. Additionally I wanted to explore modern fantasy as It&amp;rsquo;s was favorite genre of my childhood while I only barely touched it since.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyhow I end up listening books almost non-stop especially for the last year and half. Thanks to friends who provided me with recommendations today my reading list is more varied, but I managed to finish plenty of fantasy series. I was never particularly skilled at reviewing specific books and listening with extremely fast pace doesn&amp;rsquo;t help with it either, but I feel it&amp;rsquo;s time to draw some conclusions. &lt;strong>Since it&amp;rsquo;s not really reviews I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to only leave few very minor spoilers in this post so everyone can read safely!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How To: pass GPU to VM and back without X restart</title><link>https://arseniyshestakov.com/2016/03/31/how-to-pass-gpu-to-vm-and-back-without-x-restart/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://arseniyshestakov.com/2016/03/31/how-to-pass-gpu-to-vm-and-back-without-x-restart/</guid><description>&lt;p>TLDR: If you use FOSS drivers with DRI3 you now can do this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Use GPU on Linux for any 3D applications.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pass it into VM and do anything with it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once VM is shutdown use GPU on host again.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Everything without reboot and X server restart.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Experimental static website</title><link>https://arseniyshestakov.com/2015/12/23/experimental-static-website/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://arseniyshestakov.com/2015/12/23/experimental-static-website/</guid><description>This is my first attempt to create personal website using Hugo.
I&amp;rsquo;m used wordpress for almost ten years and made many projects with it, but for personal website that will be rarely updated it&amp;rsquo;s feels like overkill and ability to host it on GitHub Pages is nice advantage too.</description></item></channel></rss>
